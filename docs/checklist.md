## Phase 3: MVP Frontend Enhancement (ðŸš§ In Progress)

### Epic 3: Frontend UI Overhaul

**REMAINING MVP TASK**: The only remaining task for the MVP is to overhaul the frontend UI's look and feel while keeping the overall skeleton of the app layout exactly as it is.

* **UI Enhancement Tasks:**
  * [ ] Modernize visual design and styling
  * [ ] Improve component aesthetics and user experience
  * [ ] Enhance color scheme and typography
  * [ ] Add visual polish to existing functionality
  * [ ] Maintain current app layout structure and navigation
  * [ ] Preserve all existing functionality and data flow

**Note**: This task focuses solely on visual improvements and styling enhancements. The existing app architecture, layout structure, and functionality should remain unchanged.
